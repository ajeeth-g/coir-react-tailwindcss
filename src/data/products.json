        "description": "Mattress fibre is a natural, coarse, and resilient material extracted from the outer husk of coconuts, commonly used as a core component in mattress production. It is known for its firm support, excellent breathability, and durability. Processed through defibering and drying, the coir fibres are curled, baled, or sheeted to form mattress pads or layered composites. These fibres offer a sustainable alternative to synthetic fillings, providing natural ventilation, moisture regulation, and resistance to dust mites and fungal growth — making them ideal for eco-friendly bedding applications.",

This type of fibre is widely used in applications where uniform fibre length is not critical, such as in mattress fillings, erosion control mats, geotextiles, insulation materials, and brush manufacturing. Mixed fibre offers a cost-effective solution for bulk industrial use while retaining the natural strength, elasticity, and moisture resistance of coir.",
